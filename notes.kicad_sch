	(text_box "Differencets with GM3SEK original schematic [Tetrode boards Issue 1.24 as of July 2018]\n\n1. The pin numbers of U102 sre different. The LM324 contains four opamps, and I selected different parts \n    for the same function. This applies to U102 C and D. The other two, U102A and B have the same pin numbering \nas the original drawing.\n2. I included an extra zener diode and an optoisolator to be able to use different biasing\n   to make it possible to switch between class AB and class C. These components have indexes 301 and up.\n3. I used a 450 uF capacitor for C103 because the 220 uF cap was unavailale and actually larger.\n4. The link LK2 in the original schematic has been removed. I did not understand its purpose.\n"
